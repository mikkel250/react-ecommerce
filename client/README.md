This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
This is a mock online clothing store built with REACT, Redux, and using Firebase for the backend, and Stripe for mock payments. 

This is my current project, so it is still a work in progress, but enough of the functionality is working to have a version up live.

See the live version on Heroku at https://amazecode-clothing.herokuapp.com
