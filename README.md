This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
This is a mock online clothing store built with REACT, Redux, using Node for the backend, Firebase for the database and User Authentication, and Stripe for mock payments.

I deployed the production build to Heroku. See the live version on Heroku at https://amazecode-clothing.herokuapp.com
