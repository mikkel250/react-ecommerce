This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
This is a mock online clothing store built with React, and Redux on the frontend, Node/Express for the backend, Firebase for the database and User Authentication, and Stripe for mock payments.
I have deployed this in two places, currently:
1. [Vercel Front End using Railway Back End](https://react-ecommerce-pi-inky.vercel.app/)
2. [Railway Full Stack Deployment](https://react-ecommerce-production-b661.up.railway.app)
